# MontiCore - Language Workbench plus Tool Framework
[MontiCore](http://www.monticore.de) is a language workbench for an efficient development of domain-specific languages (DSLs). It processes an extended grammar format which defines the DSL and generates components for processing the documents written in the DSL. Examples for these components are parser, AST classes, symboltables or pretty printers.This enables a user to rapidly define a language and use it together with the MontiCore-framework to build domain specific tools.

# Release Notes

# Release Notes zu MontiCore

## MontiCore 5.0.2
* Generated by the MontiCore version 5.0.1
* Uses JavaDSL 4.3.13, Cd4Analysis 1.3.16, se-commons 1.7.9
* Introduce deprecated annotation in grammars (#2215)
* Serialization of symobls
* Add reporter IncGenCheckReporter
* Configuration of the report path
* Specific resolving methods in generated scope classes
* Bugfixes

## MontiCore 5.0.1
* Generated by the MontiCore version 5.0.0
* Uses JavaDSL 4.3.12, Cd4Analysis 1.3.13, se-commons 1.7.9
* Bugfixes
* New methods defineHookPointWithDefault in GlobalExtensionManagement **(MB)**
* new method cmpToken in MCParser **(MB)**
* every (non-)terminal defined in an interface must be present in the implementing production (including Name and Usage Name) (CoCo) **(BS)**
* to ensure that any terminal (with a specific name) has to be implemented, use an empty string, e.g. interface Expression = operator="";
* new methods are generated for the referenced symbol and definition and the definition is saved in an attribute (generated wenn you write sth. like "Name@Symbol") **(NP)**
* coco that gives a warning if you do not extend conservative **(NP)**
* coco that attributes with the same usage Name have to reference the same symbol **(NP)**
* SpannedScope and Symbol Methods in ASTNode set to deprecated **(NP)**

## MontiCore 5.0.0
* Generated by the MontiCore version 4.5.5.1
* Uses JavaDSL 4.3.11, Cd4Analysis 1.3.13, se-commons 1.7.8
* Changed name building for list attributes in grammars (x:Name* -> getXList)
* Changed api for GlobalExtensionMangament and TemplateController (see reference manual)
* New api for AST nodes (constructor, getter and setter for lists and optional attributes, ...)
* Builder classes for AST nodes are external now. Signatures are similar to those in the corresponding AST node, except those methods which set or add something, these return the Builder itself (which allows method chaining)
* Changed default script to noemf for the generation of MontiCore. If you want to use emf you can generate monticore-grammar and Java-DSL with the profile "emf". This profile also creates the emf jars. You are also able to test the integration-tests with the profile “emf-it-tests”, which contains extra tests for the generation with emf.
* Parsed grammars are not stored as class diagram anymore. CD is only stored as report.

# Build
Please make sure that your complete workspace only uses UNIX line endings (LF)
and all files are UTF-8 without BOM.
On Windows you should configure git to not automatically replace LF with CRLF during checkout by executing the following configuration:

    git config --global core.autocrlf input
